/*
__Explanation:__
#ifndef __LCD1602_H__ and #define __LCD1602_H__:

These lines ensure that the header file is included only once in a single compilation. This prevents errors due to multiple inclusions of the same header file.
Function Declarations:

void LCD_Init();: Initializes the LCD, setting it up for use.
void LCD_ShowChar(unsigned char Line, unsigned char Column, char Char);: Displays a single character at a specific line and column.
void LCD_ShowString(unsigned char Line, unsigned char Column, char *String);: Displays a string starting from a specific line and column.
void LCD_ShowNum(unsigned char Line, unsigned char Column, unsigned int Number, unsigned char Length);: Displays an unsigned number (integer) at a specific line and column.
void LCD_ShowSignedNum(unsigned char Line, unsigned char Column, int Number, unsigned char Length);: Displays a signed number (can be negative) at a specific line and column.
void LCD_ShowHexNum(unsigned char Line, unsigned char Column, unsigned int Number, unsigned char Length);: Displays a hexadecimal number at a specific line and column.
void LCD_ShowBinNum(unsigned char Line, unsigned char Column, unsigned int Number, unsigned char Length);: Displays a binary number at a specific line and column.
#endif: This ends the conditional inclusion, making sure the contents of the header are included only if __LCD1602_H__ was not previously defined.

Purpose:
This header file provides a clear and organized way to declare the functions that control the LCD, making it easy to use these functions in your main code by simply including this header file.
